Installation: No specific Python package; use requests.
python
Copy code
import requests
# Example DrugBank request (replace `your_drugbank_api_key` with actual API key)
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer your_drugbank_api_key"}
response = requests.get("https://api.drugbankplus.com/v1/drugs/DB00945/pharmacokinetics", headers=headers)
data = response.json()
3. Human Protein Atlas (for organ-specific protein expression)
API: Human Protein Atlas API
Usage: Access protein expression data across organs to simulate organ-specific responses.
Access: Requires API key registration at https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/download.
Installation: No specific package required; use requests.
python
Copy code
import requests
# Example request for protein data (replace `your_protein_atlas_api_key` with actual API key)
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer your_protein_atlas_api_key"}
response = requests.get("https://www.proteinatlas.org/api/v1/organ/brain/proteins", headers=headers)
data = response.json()
4. USDA FoodData Central (for nutritional data)
File Access: Download datasets directly as CSV from USDA FoodData Central at https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html.
Usage: Contains nutritional values for macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals to simulate food intake.
Installation: Requires pandas for CSV handling.
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
# Load CSV file containing USDA food data
food_data = pd.read_csv("path/to/food_data.csv")
5. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) (for metabolic pathways)
API: KEGG REST API
Usage: Retrieve pathway data for energy metabolism (e.g., glycolysis) relevant to cellular ATP production.
Access: No API key required.
Installation: Accessible via HTTP requests with requests.
python
Copy code
import requests
# Example request for glycolysis pathway
response = requests.get("https://rest.kegg.jp/get/map00010")
pathway_data = response.text
6. BioCyc (for metabolic pathways and nutrient data)
API: BioCyc API
Usage: Provides data on metabolic pathways, useful for simulating nutrient metabolism and energy production.
Access: Requires API key (registration at https://biocyc.org/).
Installation: No package required; use requests.
python
Copy code
import requests
# Example BioCyc request for energy metabolism pathways (replace `your_biocyc_api_key` with actual API key)
response = requests.get("https://websvc.biocyc.org/your_biocyc_api_key/jsonapi/getpathway?type=energy_metabolism")
data = response.json()
7. NCBI ClinVar (for genetic mutation data)
API: NCBI E-utilities API for ClinVar
Usage: Access genetic mutations relevant to drug responses or disease susceptibility.
Access: No API key needed.
Installation: Use requests to make HTTP requests.
python
Copy code
import requests
# Example request for gene mutation information related to drug metabolism
response = requests.get("https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esummary.fcgi?db=clinvar&id=12345")
data = response.text
8. OpenWeatherMap or NOAA (for temperature and environmental data)
API: OpenWeatherMap API or NOAA API
Usage: Obtain temperature data to simulate environmental effects on body temperature.
Access: Requires API key for OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/) or NOAA (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token).
Installation: No specific package required; use requests.
python
Copy code
import requests
# Example OpenWeatherMap request (replace `your_openweather_api_key` with actual API key)
response = requests.get(f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=your_openweather_api_key")
weather_data = response.json()
Additional Required Python Libraries
Requests (for API requests)

bash
Copy code
pip install requests
Pandas (for data handling, especially USDA FoodData CSVs)

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas
NumPy (for numerical data operations and Mayavi visualization)

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
Mayavi (for 3D visualization)

Mayavi requires VTK as well; installing it can be complex, but the following should work for most environments.
bash
Copy code
pip install mayavi
Matplotlib (optional, for 2D plotting if Mayavi is unavailable)

bash
Copy code
pip install matplotlib
These APIs and datasets provide the necessary components to support comprehensive simulations of genetic, metabolic, nutritional, and environmental influences on the bodyâ€™s physiology. Let me know if you need help with more specific configurations or further additions!
