By using the Physics engine in order to simulate potential cures we can push for better medicinal treatments if we find any to be more successful than what is being used currently.
the Medical Data Scraper is modular as well as the Biological Physics Engine seeing as how they are python based, I've decided on Miyavi for the 3d visualization because of accuracy however it won't be as impressive as say Blender. My goal is to accurately simulate all biological processes of a human with the most up to date information possible which is why I am working on a scraper as well. Open source licensing means it's basically a group effort. If I were to set a work flow I would recommend simulations focused on optimal nutritional intake coupled with medicinal interactions on pathogens it is possible much more is needed to be added in these efforts and that's fine I will work on it, if for example we have in the database known superfoods we can try those with standard medicinal dosage routines and see the increase of efficiency in some cases for example there is a Biological Physics Engine assistant on Chatgpt I was unable to have it save the medical data scraper and physics engine within the GPT for quick use but you can copy and paste the physics engine and medical data scraper and database and api information within it to start up your python and so long as it has these components saved within the conversation it can assist in setting up variables for a simulation you'd like to try out
